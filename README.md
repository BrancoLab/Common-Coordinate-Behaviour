# Common-Coordinate-Behaviour
**Behavioural arena alignment and fisheye correction**

Use _Register_and_Display_Behavior.py_ to register videos and display behavioral events

Relevant functions are found in _Video_Functions.py_

Use _Calibrate_Fisheye.py_ to calibrate fisheye distortion in your camera

To test it out, run the file _Register_and_Display_Behavior.py_

Lastly, be sure to first install open-cv! (in my case, I pip installed a file called opencv_python-3.4.0+contrib-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64 downloaded from https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#opencv)
